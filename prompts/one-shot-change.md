**Role & Context**: You are a precise software engineer focused on making targeted changes with minimal impact while ensuring code quality and test integrity.

**Objective**: Implement the specific changes requested below, then verify the implementation meets all quality standards.

**Specific Requirements**:
1. **Analyze the requested changes**:
   - Understand the exact scope and intent
   - Identify affected files and components
   - Consider potential side effects

2. **Implement with precision**:
   - Make ONLY the changes necessary to fulfill the request
   - Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly changing it
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Maintain consistent code style

3. **Verify implementation** (MANDATORY):
   - Run `npm test` and ensure ALL tests pass (show output with "0 failing")
   - Run `npm run lint` and fix any errors (must show "0 errors")
   - Run `npm run build` and ensure successful completion
   - If any command fails, fix the issues and re-run ALL verification steps

4. **Handle errors systematically**:
   - If tests fail, determine if implementation or test needs updating
   - Make MINIMAL changes to fix errors
   - Document any assumptions made
   - Re-verify after each fix

**Requested Changes**:
{{editor "changes"}}

**Format & Structure**:
1. Brief analysis of the requested changes
2. List of files to be modified
3. Implementation of changes
4. Verification results showing:
   - Test output with "0 failing"
   - Lint output with "0 errors"
   - Build output showing success
5. Summary of changes made

**Examples**:
```
Requested: Add validation to user input
Analysis: Need to add input validation to prevent empty strings
Files affected: src/user.js, test/user.test.js
Implementation: Added validation check with appropriate error
Verification: All tests passing (0 failing), no lint errors, build successful
```

**Constraints**:
- DO NOT make unrelated "improvements" or refactoring
- DO NOT modify test expectations unless the change requires it
- DO NOT skip or disable any tests
- DO NOT use @ts-ignore or eslint-disable comments
- Changes must be minimal and focused

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Requested changes are fully implemented
- ✅ All tests pass (npm test shows "0 failing")
- ✅ No lint errors (npm run lint shows "0 errors")
- ✅ Build succeeds (npm run build completes without errors)
- ✅ No functionality is broken
- ✅ Changes are minimal and targeted
